1. I'm thinking of creating a food/recipe collective website - essentially easy to cook meals during quarantine. So this will have recipes, youtube videos, etc. for all types (spicy, mild, medium) of foods from a variety of cultures.


2. Primary audience would be anyone (from a novice to chef) looking to learn how to cook something new or just looking for some inspiration/ideas of what to try out for breakfast/lunch/dinner.

3. Anyone can add a recipe (create), view all recipes (read), edit their own recipes (update), delete (delete their recipes). This would implement all of the CRUD functionalities.

4. Additional features could include both commenting and bookmarking. People can comment on recipes to provide suggestions or tips and people can bookmark their favorite recipes. Both sound applicable to this site, so if time allows, I'll try to do both.
